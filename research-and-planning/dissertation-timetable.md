_Each week belongs to the month that the Sunday is on_

Exams are June 8 and June 10

TODO to plan:
* Continue planning points for APSP subchapter
- [o] Go through design decision diary and add points as fit
- [o] Also go through notebook and add points as see fit
* In researchAndPlanning/Readme.md, there are still references/notes for eval and intro,
  that I should go through when writing those chapters...

* More measurements for generous latency (200ms, around equator)
  and average UK broadband speed https://www.itpro.co.uk/network-internet/broadband/360866/uk-broadband-speeds-ninth-slowest-in-europe

On path to 0th draft (expected effort)
* Write introduction, covering motvation etc. (great)            DONE
* Fix up some writing in APSP explain         (small)            DONE
* Write implementation intro, with. repo ovw  (medium)           DONE
* Create graph compression diagram and refer  (small++)          DONE
* Write prep introduction and conc.           (medium-)          DONE
* Do refactoring, and add screenshot unit test(small)            DONE
* Read through eval., then add intr+conc      (medium-)          DONE
* Write conclusions                           (large)            DONE
* Fix diagram layout                          (small+)           DONE


Fine cleanup:
* Read pink book and note requiremnets like "mention algorithm require understanding in preperation chapter"


TODO on rough cleanup:
* First, go through each chapter.section and:
  * Note the points mentioned already there, and look at notebook / vimwiki
    if there are any more points to add
  * Add missing points and or diagrams if necessary
  * As go through notes and notebook, add more citations used...
* Then set-up **sign-posts**, including introduction paragraphs ("temasetning senere")
* Write introduction + conclusion with future work...

Diagram cleanups:
* 2.1 in preperation, add graph reader / input graph distinction
* 3.2.4 Estimating time, add the diagram for stalling, and a par. explaining it!
Paragraphs requiring more elaborate tidying:
* APSP via repeated matSquaring

TODO Larry draft by Tuesday:
* Go through writing in implementation, and **shorten** the different sections.
  Cut out what's unceecsarry, e.g. predecessor matrix?, example graph?, and
  write more compact, so that you can cut 2 pages off!
* Go through `pink book` again and note key things that should we there, and things to
  emphasize, then combine it below Larry tip to make sure things clear to the reader
* Go through the other chapters and write more nicely as well

TODO fine clean:
* Use reference numbers clickable instead DONE
* Cleverref fix,                          started
* Go through all paragraphs, and phrase things better (+ add "temasetninger")
* As Larry said, figure out what are the **most important points** and
  highlight these, write them multiple times, _make sure_ someone reading through
  the dissertation very quickly picks them up
* Rearrange the figures such that they appear in suitable locations, not 5 pages
  after they are referenced

Last couple of TODO:
* Add description of evaluation.py, and indicate 100 lines not written
* (Possible add something below main heading in introduction?)
* Add "Parallel system simulator" box in fig 2.1, high-level overview in prep
* Rearrange diagrams so doesn't go out of bounds...
* Have a look through all of the code and remove sus comments!
* Add new unit test screenshot (collapsed)
* Full unit test code repository in appendix
* Full screenshot of unit tests in appendix as well
* Go over each diagram and fix in inkscape possibly
* Finally, redo line and word count

Fix up text in implementation, then move memory model infront of work management
Mention "only possible because of seperating computation into phases" on time trick


## Current status

Introduction:

Preperation:
* At 2500 words (allotted 2500, so may shorten it somewhat)

Implementation:
* At 3400 words (allotted 4500 words) (and 14 pages, 35% of max page count
                                       and is 40% of marks)

Evaluation:
* At 2000 words (allotted 2000, so can add a tiny bit more?)
* Still don't have California timing plot

Conclusion:
