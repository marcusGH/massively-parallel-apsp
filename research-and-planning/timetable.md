# Timetable

_Meta: move whole timetable 1-2 weeks back?_
* For 2 weeks ahead, the dissertation is still submitted 3 weeks before
  deadline, and the progress report is sent in just in time
* So, maybe slack a bit (1 week) at starting research+planning, then get up to speed (1 week) in vacation?

Research phase (done by Nov. 3):
- [ ] Finished all the TODOs on the main page
