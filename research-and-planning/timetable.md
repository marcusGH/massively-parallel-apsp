# Timetable

_Meta: move whole timetable 1-2 weeks back?_
* For 2 weeks ahead, the dissertation is still submitted 3 weeks before
  deadline, and the progress report is sent in just in time
* So, maybe slack a bit (1 week) at starting research+planning, then get up to speed (1 week) in vacation?

What TODO now:
* Go through all of code so far, execute refactor TODOs and refactor complete Worker -> Algorithm, and write some more **class documentation**
* Write new implementation progress list, and the next items to add are: Add timing wrapper for Algorithm and Manager, Add SSSP Dijkstra (that finds all paths) and can be used for testing

Implementation progress:
- [o] memoryModel
  - [X] Written all methods
  - [X] Written some documentation for them
  - [o] Written unit tests for them
- [ ] graphReader:
  - [ ] Written all methods
  - [ ] Written some docs
  - [ ] Tested the code
- [ ] driver:
  - [ ] Planned methods
  - [ ] Written methods
  - [ ] Written docs
  - [ ] Tested code
- [ ] parallelMatrixMultiplication:
  - [ ] Written Fox-Otto
  - [ ] Docs
  - [ ] Tested code
- [ ] evaluation (rename):
  - [ ] Planned and written evaluation package
  - [ ] ...
- [ ] generalised algorithm
- [ ] graphCompression:
  - [ ] ...

Research progress:
- [X] Worked through formalism on choosing predecessor to use:
  - [X] Read online resources found on it
  - [X] Sketch a proof?


TODO list:
* Create Factories
* Write tests in conjunction with writing docs for all
* Refactor memoryModel on a package level
-> After all this, start working through formalism of APSP,
   then start implementing the APSP stuff
