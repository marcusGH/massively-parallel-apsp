# Progress report

Deadline: **February 4th**

Written report: 300 - 500 words
Oral presentation: about 5 minutes (no more than4 slides)

Contents (excluding formalities):
* An indication of what work has been completed and how this relates to the
  timetable and work plan in the original proposal. The progress report
  should answer the following questions:
  * Is the project on schedule and if not, how many weeks behind or ahead?
  * What unexpected difficulties have arisen?
  * If the project is behind, what actions have been taken to address this and when will progress be back on track?
  * Briefly, what has been accomplished?

_It should be possible to understand the progress report independently of the_
_original proposal, thus 'I have completed implementing the wombat module'_
_rather than 'I have completed points 1 and 3 in the proposal but not point 2'._

## Planning

According to timetable, by then I should be finished with the following
main items of work:
* Data set extractor, preparer modules
* Multiprocessor simulation
* APSP driver algorithm (also reconstructs paths)
* FoxOtto implementation
* **Evaluated performance**
* (tested for correctness)

What I thus definitely need to do before report due is the **evaluation constants** and
done some more code on extracting all the timings, making a module for aggregating these
into files (`.csv`s) that can be plotted...

To be ahead of schedule, I need to have started the generalising part etc.


Questions:
* Who is the target? Should I assume audience know proposal? Or introduce project?
