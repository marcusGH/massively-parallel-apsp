## Research plan

% TODO: continue on from 8.4 in the pink book

- [x] Read _The Pink Book_, watch the "How to write a dissertation" lecture
      (and other material?) with the aim of answering the question: "What makes
      a good dissertation?"
- [ ] Read all 4 of past projects, taking note of:
  * Their references/bibliography
  * What major items they put into the 5 chapters
  * Their method of evaluation
- [ ] Area of knowledge to further expand on/read about:
  - [ ] General knowledge about _parallel_ computing concepts
  - [ ] Evaluating parallel performance
  - [ ] General overview of the different parallel matrix multiplication techniques

**Milestones:**
- [ ] Got hold of Modi's book from library
- [ ] Written some small fragments of Java code that uses concepts
  * _Remember: important part of preparation phase is getting practice in what you'll do in the main implementation phase_
- [ ] The _Work plan_ is fleshed out in a lot more detail

## Preparation plan

- [ ] Plan code structure and `make` file
- [ ] Plan specific evidence in evaluation (recollect ideas from notebook on this)
