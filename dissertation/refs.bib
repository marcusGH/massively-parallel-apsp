abstract = {We discuss algorithms for matrix multiplication on a concurrent processor containing a two-dimensional mesh or richer topology. We present detailed performance measurements on hypercubes with 4, 16, and 64 nodes, and analyze them in terms of communication overhead and load balancing. We show that the decomposition into square subblocks is optimal C code implementing the algorithms is available.}
